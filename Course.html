                        <p>
                            We offer cutting-edge expertise in a variety of courses that combine technological advances
                            and business practices. We stress creative and inventive approaches to problem solving,
                            which necessitates empowering students so that they can take charge of their own software
                            projects to become originally productive. Our information systems program is as much an art
                            as a science. It bypasses mechanical learning and highlights the value and excitement of
                            engineering thinking that gets things done efficiently as well as imaginatively. We balance
                            theory and practice, on the premise that they are always intertwined and interdependent.
                            We seek to provide a basic foundation for our students and then seek to push them to new
                            heights to advance their information technology skills in a way that keeps up and, better

                            The rapid advancement of technology within healthcare and other sectors has driven the
                            evolution of a complex global regulatory landscape and concurrently created the need for
                            professionals with the skills necessary to facilitate the commercialization of products used
                            therein. In response to this demand, Northeastern University’s College of Professional
                            Studies offers the Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs degree.
                            This unique graduate degree is designed to both broaden and deepen the student’s
                            understanding of current global compliance requirements and their practical application in
                            the design, development, approval, and postmarketing of products utilized within regulated
                            industries. Courses within this degree program provide students with the opportunity to
                            integrate scientific and technical knowledge and engineering and regulatory perspectives
                            within the larger context of global product commercialization. From research and discovery
                            through the postmarket phase of product utilization, the Master of Science in Regulatory
                            Affairs degree examines the processes required for stakeholders to maintain compliance to
                            product standards and regulations throughout the global marketplace.

                                            I was in love at the first bite with the quality of their dressing and that
                                            is one of the most important thing in this cuisine.</p>

                                            place where my love for it began. The taste was something special with a

                                            nice to us every time we come. I look forward to going back again and again.
                                            Highly recommend trying them out!</p>

                                        <p>Classic Indian cuisine, well made, and the prices haven't gone up that much
                                            since I was last there many years ago, making this one of the rare
                                            affordable places to get a great meal! Also, they are the only place I know
